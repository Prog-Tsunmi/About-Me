Preamble
This Prog-Tsunmi Source Available License (the "License") governs the use, modification, and distribution of all software, code, and associated documentation files (collectively the "Software") created by and attributed to Prog-Tsunmi. By exercising any rights to the Software, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this License.

1. Universal Application
This License applies universally to every single code file, script, component, and software asset created by Prog-Tsunmi across all repositories, projects, and distributions unless explicitly stated otherwise in the file header.

2. Definitions
- "You" (or "Your") refers to any individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
- "Use" means to load, execute, display, perform, copy, or run the Software.
- "Distribution" means any form of sharing, publishing, or transferring the Software or a Derivative Work to a third party.
- "Derivative Work" means any work, whether in source or object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Software.

3. No Rights Granted: General Prohibition
All rights to the Original Prog-Tsunmi Code are expressly reserved by Prog-Tsunmi. Except as explicitly stated in Section 4, you are granted no rights to Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Original Prog-Tsunmi Code.

4. Limited Permissions
The general prohibition in Section 3 does not apply, and you are granted a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to Use the Software, only under one of the following two conditions:

A. Free Use: You may Use the Software for personal, non-commercial, or internal business purposes without charge and without the need for prior permission, provided you do not Distribute the Software or any Derivative Work.

B. Prior Paid Permission: You may Use the Software for any other purpose, including commercial use or Distribution, only after you have obtained express, prior written permission from Prog-Tsunmi. Such permission is granted at the sole discretion of Prog-Tsunmi and will typically be contingent upon the payment of a license fee.

5. Forked and Edited Code Exclusion
Notwithstanding any other provision in this License, any code that has been forked, modified, edited, or derived from the Original Prog-Tsunmi Code (collectively "Forked Code") is explicitly excluded from the terms of this License. Once code has been forked and modified:

- The Forked Code is no longer considered "Original Prog-Tsunmi Code"
- This License does not apply to the Forked Code
- The creator of the Forked Code may license their modifications under any terms they choose
- However, any portions of Original Prog-Tsunmi Code remaining within the Forked Code remain subject to this License

6. Restrictions
Any use not explicitly permitted under Section 4 is strictly prohibited. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you are specifically prohibited from, and may not allow others to:
- Incorporate the Original Prog-Tsunmi Code into any product or service intended for Distribution without a separate agreement with Prog-Tsunmi.
- Use the Original Prog-Tsunmi Code to provide a service to third parties (e.g., as part of a Software-as-a-Service offering) without a separate agreement with Prog-Tsunmi.
- Remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) contained within the Original Prog-Tsunmi Code.

8. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL PROG-TSUNMI BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF PROG-TSUNMI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by you of the terms of this License. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control.
